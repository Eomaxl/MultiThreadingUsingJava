Design and implement an in-memory, multithreaded queue system similar to Amazon Simple Queue Service(SQS) that allows for asynchronous message processing.
The system should provide a realible way to transfer messages between different parts of an application, ensuring that each message is processed by a customer.
The queue should support multiple producers and consumers operating concurrently.

Example: Addition Worker - 5 seconds
Message: 2 numbers.
